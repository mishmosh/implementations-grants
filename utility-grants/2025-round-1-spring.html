  <h1>IPFS <br>Implementations <br>Grants</h1>
  <p>
    The IPFS Implementations Grants program was established in 2022 to advance the development, growth, and impact
    of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) project through a focus on developer choice and availability. We provide
    financial support to projects and teams working on integrations, extensions, and new implementations that make
    IPFS accessible to more developer communities across a variety of languages, platforms, and systems.
  </p>


  <h2>Spring 2025 Request for Proposals: Content-Addressed Data Tools</h2>
  <p><i>Note: The Spring 2025 round is now closed.</i></p>


  <p>The IPFS Implementations Fund supports a more open, resilient, and efficient web by funding implementations of the <a href="https://specs.ipfs.tech/">IPFS protocol</a>. It aims to broaden the reach and impact of the IPFS project by making content addressing and peer-to-peer networking more accessible across different platforms, programming languages, environments, and use cases.</p>
  <p>Our Utility Grants program supports developers creating essential utilities, libraries, and tooling. Grants of $5,000-25,000 per project aim to fill critical tooling gaps and strengthen the foundations of an open and interoperable web.</p>
  <p>For the Spring 2025 cycle, we seek proposals from qualified individuals or teams for the following:</p>


  <h3>RFP #2025-01: CAR Archive Explorers and Utilities</h3>
  <p>The CAR format (Content Addressable aRchives) makes data reliably portable by packaging up content with its cryptographic identifiers. This ensures the same data can be verified and used across different systems and platforms, making it a good building block for “credible exit” and data portability. Typically found in a file with a <code>.car</code> filename extension, you can think of them like TAR files that are designed for storing collections of content addressed data.</p>
  <p>Originally created as a way to create stable documents from large or dynamic IPLD graphs (including those graphs that populate “virtual directories” of files added to IPFS), CAR files can now be found in IPFS-based systems, Storacha, ATProto, and other open source projects. With growing interest in data independence – moving large datasets between storage providers, backing up personal content from hosted services, and maintaining data integrity across the web – there's a growing need for accessible tools that help people create, inspect, and manage their own CAR files.</p>
  <p>Currently, there is limited stand-alone tooling for the CAR format. Prior art includes <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/#ipfs-dag-import">kubo</a>'s <code>dag import</code> and <code></code>dag export</code> CLIs, <a href="https://github.com/hsanjuan/caribdis">caribdis</a>, and Bluesky’s <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/blob/main/cmd/goat/repo.go">goat</a>, but they are mostly embedded within larger app-specific libraries and not ergonomic to use outside of that context. Standalone tools include <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-car">ipfs-car</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ipld/go-car">go-car</a>.</p>


  <p>We are interested in tools that make CAR archives more useful and/or more usable. Command line tools, utility libraries, and browser-based explorers are equally welcome. Enhancements or extensions to existing tools or platforms are especially encouraged.</p>


  <h3>RFP #2025-02: DASL Testing</h3>
  <p>DASL (Data-Addressed Structures &amp; Links, pronounced "dazzle") is a small set of simple, standard primitives for working with content-addressable resources on today’s or tomorrow’s web. It is a strict subset of IPFS CIDs and IPLD, optimized for simplicity, HTTP, and longevity.</p>
  <p>The DASL spec was published in December 2024, and is currently supported by <a href="https://dasl.ing/#how">9 implementations or tools</a>. Now, let’s test it. We are interested in proposals with two phases:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>First, authoring a set of tests and designing a few happy-path and failure test cases for DASL (specifically its <a href="https://dasl.ing/#spec">CID, dCBOR42, and CAR specs</a>).</li>
  <li>Second, testing against real-world implementations in approximate conformance and working through spec changes and/or test changes towards a “minor version” that exhausts major corner-cases and ambiguities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additional notes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Applicants should make sure that this works as a loop with the spec to clarify and improve it as needed, rather than slavishly follow it. The DASL authors will be available for discussion and collaboration.</li>
  <li>Proposals should include a list of implementations (at least one ATProto-based) to test against, to ensure alignment of spec, test suite, and implementations.</li>
  <li>See <a href="https://github.com/darobin/dasl.ing/issues/25">https://github.com/darobin/dasl.ing/issues/25</a> for prior discussion.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>RFP #2025-03: Improving Data Utilities</h3>
  <p>Recently, several new utilities, libraries, and tools have emerged for working with content-addressed data (CIDs, IPLD, DASL). We welcome these new contributions to the content-addressed ecosystem! We are interested in proposals to improve both longtime and emerging utilities.</p>
  <p>The scope of work can range broadly, from technical improvements to docs, code examples, outreach, or education. This RFP is focused on active projects that show evidence of current usage and adoption (for example, Github stars, a variety of issue creators, a healthy dependency graph).</p>
