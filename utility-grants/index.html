  <h1>IPFS <br>Implementations <br>Grants</h1>
  <p>
    The IPFS Implementations Grants program was established in 2022 to advance the development, growth, and impact
    of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) project through a focus on developer choice and availability. We provide
    financial support to projects and teams working on integrations, extensions, and new implementations that make
    IPFS accessible to more developer communities across a variety of languages, platforms, and systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Summer 2025 Request for Proposals: Content-Addressed Data Tools</h2>
  <p>The IPFS Implementations Fund supports a more open, resilient, and efficient web by funding implementations of the <a href="https://specs.ipfs.tech/">IPFS protocol</a>. It aims to broaden the reach and impact of the IPFS project by making content addressing and peer-to-peer networking more accessible across different platforms, programming languages, environments, and use cases.</p>
  <p>Our Utility Grants program supports developers creating essential utilities, libraries, and tooling. Grants of $5,000-25,000 per project aim to fill critical tooling gaps and strengthen the foundations of an open and interoperable web.</p>
  <p>For the Summer 2025 cycle, we seek proposals from qualified individuals or teams for the following:</p>

  <h3>RFP #2025-04: Lean and Performant Libraries</h3>
  <p>Now that a <a href="https://dasl.ing/">DASL</a> test suite is in place, we are seeking proposals for lean and performant implementations in commonly used languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C, C#, or others with demonstrated developer adoption. These libraries should prioritize minimal dependencies, fast execution, and ergonomic APIs that make DASL accessible to developers who may be new to content-addressed systems. Implementations should include core DASL functionality including CID handling, dCBOR42 encoding/decoding, and basic CAR file operations. They may also include additional capabilities such as range requests.</p>

  <p></p>Successful proposals will demonstrate clear performance benchmarks, consideration for multiple sizes and configurations of files and folders, minimal memory footprint, and straightforward integration patterns. We're particularly interested in libraries that can serve as drop-in components for existing web applications, API services, or data processing pipelines in large-scale production environments. Projects should include documentation and usage examples.</p> 

  <p>Additional notes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Applicants should make sure that this works as a loop with the spec to clarify and improve it as needed, rather than slavishly follow it. The DASL authors will be available for discussion and collaboration.</li>
  <li>Projects should demonstrate compliance with the <a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/dasl-testing">DASL testing suite</a></li>.
  <li>We expect to select proposals for a small number of the listed languages, and rely on language bindings for the rest.</li>
  <li>Collaboration and benchmarking with production systems is strongly preferred.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Proposal Document</h3>
  <p>Please prepare a clear and concise proposal (no longer than 2 pages) with the following sections and submit it to <a href="mailto:utility-grants@ipfs.io">utility-grants@ipfs.io</a>:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Project Overview</li>
  <li>Technical Design</li>
  <li>User Feedback and Adoption Plan</li>
  <li>Schedule and Budget</li>
  <li>Qualifications of Team, including prior experience with content-addressed systems and performance</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Information</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>License: Projects must be licensed under the MIT and/or Apache-2.0 licenses. </li>
  <li>Duration: This program targets projects of 1-3 months. Exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</li>
  <li>Contributions to existing projects:</li> If you are proposing to improve an existing project of which you are not a maintainer, please check with the maintainer(s) first. Your proposal should link to an issue or other artifact showing that you have discussed the proposed change with the maintainer, incorporated any feedback, and that they support and will be available to review your PRs.
  <li>Project Communications:
    <ul>
    <li>Grantees are expected to publish an overview and introduction to their project upon completion. This can be on a personal blog or website, the IPFS Forum, or other public place.</li>
    <li>Grantees will give a brief presentation at a virtual showcase. Depending on your proposed timeline, projects are not required to be completed at this time, but should have enough progress for a meaningful presentation.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Important Dates</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Proposals will be considered on a rolling basis. </li>
  <li>Submission Deadline: August 31, 2025</li>
